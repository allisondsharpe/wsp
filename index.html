                <p>My name is Allison Sharpe. I was born and raised in Moultrie, Ga. I'm currently enrolled as a full-time online student at Full Sail University. I enjoy working with computers and playing video games in my spare time. Technology has always played a huge role in my life. I've had an interest in technology ever since I was a kid and to this very day I am still seeking more ways to further my knowledge and understanding with technology. </p>

            <h1> 1) Header </h1>
            <img src="components/1/header.png" alt="Header" style="border: 1px solid #eee; width: 860px; height: 290px;">
            <div id="headerArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "header article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> This header will most likely appeal to anyone young or mature who is looking for the best online shopping experience. As soon as they first come to the home page, they will be introduced to this eye-catching header that will introduce them to many features/selections the webpage has to offer. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal of this header is to provide the client with a quick and easy way to find what they need by promoting various items without the hassle of having to waste their time searching for it. Of course, that is an option as well.  </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design/layout for this header says "motivation." The colors used are very upbeat and energetic. The color yellow mixed with the color green make a great combination and because of this the user will then be drawn in to these cheerful and energetic colors. The laptop and mouse logo sets the atmosphere for electronic lovers who may be looking for an easier way to shop online. Besides the background image, the tagline "pick your pleasure" stood out to me as well since it gives this header originality and taste.

            <img src="components/2/about.png" alt="About" style="border: 1px solid #eee; width: 650px; height: 270px;">
            <div id="aboutArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "about article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The about section of this website will most likely appeal to someone who is interested in purchasing or selling various items, such as, clothing, electronics, etc. Anyone from every age and social group will find this website useful. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for this website would be to allow our users to have the best and most convenient experience possible while purchasing items or merchandise. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design is simple and professionally laid out. The "about" section alone provides the user with many options to choose from as well as links to other sources to make the user's shopping experience more enjoyable. In the left hand corder you have the company logo, in which I feel is a nice touch, as well as the company biography right next to it. These two things provide the user with a sense of trust and stability. Down below you have a list of options which are highlighted by the color blue. This color stands out from the rest of the text because it represents a completely different energy and emotional feeling, opposed to the neutral colored text. It also provides the user with more options to choose from or browse. </p>

<!-- 3) CTA -->

        <div id="cta"> <!-- opening id tag for "cta" -->

            <h1> 3) CTA: "Call to Action" </h1>
            <img src="components/3/cta.png" alt="CTA" style="border: 1px solid #eee; width: 600px; height: 250px;">
            <div id="ctaArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "cta article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The cta or the "call to action" would most likely appeal to someone who may be interested in having or at the very least browsing the latest electronic devices. This is also intended for anyone looking for a great father's day gift! </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for this cta is to promote our merchandise to our users so in return they will most likely see this advertisement and will want to make a purchase, or at the least will consider the opportunity. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The unique pattern at the top of this cta stands out the most. The colors used are white and a nice shade of navy blue. White represents "light" and "purity", where the color blue here represents "trust" and "honesty." The color blue is used not only for the pattern, but for the typography as well. This will make the brand appear more reliable and trustworthy to the user. It also creates a "hierarchy" that will lead the user down step by step. </p>

<!-- 4) FEATURES -->

            <img src="components/4/features.png" alt="Features" style="border: 1px solid #eee; width: 630px; height: 350px;">
            <div id="featuresArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "features article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for these featured items would be anyone interested in buying horse racing items as well as anyone who may be interested in buying clothing and accessories. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for this section of the website is to provide the users with another quick and easy way of finding items that best suit their needs, except instead of them being advertised individually, they come in a bundle so that way the user will have a nice selection to choose from instead of having to browse each item separately. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout for this component nicely laid out and has a large or main image for each feature. For example, in the first feature you have an image of horse racers in action. For the second feature you have a woman wearing a beautifully made dress with a happy expression on her face. These images set the tone for the feature entirely because they display a particular emotion for the feature. For example, the girl on the right is smiling while she appears to be dancing. This will make the user want to check out these features more because it will make them feel "happy" and "cheerful." As for the font, there is a "shop now" option that is highlighted by the color "blue." By using a color instead of a neutral color for this option, this creates a more calming atmosphere for the user and will most likely allow them to click on the option rather than ignore it. </p>

<!-- 5) TEAM -->

        <div id="team"> <!-- opening id tag for "team" -->

            <h1> 5) Meet the Team </h1>
            <img src="components/5/team.png" alt="Meet the Team" style="border: 1px solid #eee; width: 700px; height: 400px;">
            <div id="teamArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "team article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for this component would be for anyone who may be interested in furthering their knowledge of the company or would like to get in contact with someone from the team who may be of assistance.</p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for this portion of the website is to give the users the opportunity to become more familiar with the employees so that way if they were to ever need assistance they could easily contact one of the team members just by browsing this section of the website. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout/design is well laid out and easy to navigate. Every team member's image has a circular border that makes the image more appealing to the user. The font colors are a dark grey color that create a neutral and unemotional feeling for the user, where as the options to contact one of the team members via through social media or other sources is a nice shade of blue, that in which highlights these options so that the user will most likely want to use them. The color blue is used here as well to highlight these options. This will enable the user to rely on the brand more than they would if it were any other color since blue represents "trust" and "loyalty." </p>

            <div id="contactArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "contact article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for this particular portion of the website would anyone viewing the website who may need help or would like to get in touch with our company. This would also apply for those who may be seeking employment. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for this portion of the website is to allow any user to ask questions or to have a personal conversation with one of our representatives. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design for this component is very well thought out and looks to be as convenient for the user as necessary. It's not just the standard message box and submit button. This piece of design was structured to appeal to the user as much as possible. Not only do you have the option to get in contact, but you also have the option to seek help by selection one of the options that relates mostly to your area of interest. The user will feel a sense of stability and trust since rather than if they only had the standard message box and submit button to choose from. The color green is used to highlight each numbered selection. The color green represents "balance" and "harmony", which will make the user feel more at peace when choosing a selection. </p>

            <div id="loginArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "login article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for this component would be anyone who is already a member or would like to become member of the website. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose of the log in/register page would be the "opening door" of the webpage so to speak. This will allow anyone to sign in/up and give them access to features limited to members only.  </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout is simple and easy to use. The color blue creates a "calming" and "professional" atmosphere for the user. The color blue is considered to be one of the most used colors when creating or designing buttons. This color is best to use since it's favored by most and users will be more willing to access the website. On the left-hand side a darker shade of blue is used for the login section. The darker shade of blue represents "knowledge" and "integrity." Users who are already members will most likely understand these emotions since they have experienced the website first hand. On the right-hand side, you have the register button which appears to be a lighter shade of blue. This shade of blue represents "tranquility" and "understanding", which will provide new users with the comfort in feeling as if they've made the right choice when signing up for this website.  </p>

            <div id="navigationArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "navigation article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for this portion of the website would be anyone who is currently interested in browsing various sections of the website as well as anyone who may want to return to a specific section. A good example being the "home page" or for this navigational bar in particular, the section for "today."</p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for the navigational bar would be to help guide the user through various sections of the website with the ease of clicking a button. Having a navigational bar is useful and recommended when creating a website in order to provide the user with the easiest and most convenient experience possible. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design or layout for this navigational bar is simple, yet unique. The grey background creates a neutral feel that can provide the users with a sense of "indecisiveness", while still maintaining a professional outlook. The black highlight that appears whenever the user clicks on a selection will stand out the most since black is a bold color that provides the user with a sense of "elegance" and "stability." </p>

            <div id="searchArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "search article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for this portion of the website would be anyone who may need to search for an item in particular that may not be included in one the navigational selections. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for the search bar is to allow the user to interact with the website by giving them the option to search for an item to receive direct results. The users will also have the option to search for an item by "category" instead of just the manual way of searching. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout/design for the search bar is laid out nicely and appears to be quick and easy for the user to receive direct results because of advanced category options. The background inside the search bar is white, standing out from the main background to highlight the search bar's existence. The submit button is blue, giving it a very "professional" and "trustworthy" appearance, where if it were the submit button were the color red, this would confuse the user since the color red is typically used as a message of "warning" or "caution." </p>

            <div id="footerArticle"> <!-- opening id tag for "footer article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The target audience for the footer area of this website would be anyone who may be searching for more information, such as contact information, help options, etc. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal of the footer is to not only close out the webpage in a nice and effective way, but to also provide a list of information the user may need that wouldn't likely be provided in the header or the body. The footer typically provided the copyright information as well as many other optional resources for the user. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> Opposing themes work best for the footer because it creates a its own atmosphere and almost separates itself from the rest of the page. This design in particular is professionally laid out and has an elegant appearance. The color black used for the background creates an elegant appearance because the color black represents "power" and "class." The color blue is used to highlight the main points as well as the main key words. The color blue provides the user with "stability" and "trust." These two colors mixed together creates a calming, and yet powerful atmosphere for the footer. The option at the bottom is a useful feature because the user will have the ability to share this website on multiple social networking sites of their choosing. </p>
