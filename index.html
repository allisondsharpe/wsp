            <p>My name is Allison Sharpe. I was born and raised in Moultrie, Ga. I'm currently enrolled as a full-time online student at Full Sail University. I enjoy working with computers and playing video games in my spare time. Technology has always played a huge role in my life. I've had an interest in technology ever since I was a kid and to this very day I am still seeking more ways to further my knowledge and understanding with technology. </p>

            <h1> 1) Header </h1>
            <img src="components/1/header.png" alt="Header Image for WSP: Component 1">
            <article> <!-- opening article tag -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> This header will most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-65 who are looking for the best online shopping experience. Those between the ages of 18-35, who will have more likely adapted to the modern age of technology, will find this website more beneficial to their needs since they will have the ability to shop online rather than having to leave their own homes. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The purpose of this header is to provide the client with a quick and easy way to navigate through various selections through out the website. This header also provides the user with the company's brand name logo as well as many other useful features to make browsing more convenient for the user.  </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design/layout for this header has a background that's a shade of white, which gives the header a clean appearance since the color white typically represents "purity" and "cleanliness." The color green, however, is a shade of jade green, giving the header a sense of "trust" and "confidentiality," because of this, the user will feel a sense of enlightenment due to this shade of green having a generous spirit. The header is the most relevant part of the website since users will take use of the navigational bar as well as the search bar more often than they will any other feature, so it's best to not only have a header, but for the header to be as effective to the user as possible. </p>

<!-- 2) ABOUT -->

        <section id="about"> <!-- opening section tag for "about" -->

            <h1> 2) About </h1>
            <img src="components/2/about.png" alt="About Image for WSP: Component 2">
            <article id="aboutArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "about article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The about section of this website will most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-65 who are interested in purchasing or selling various items, such as, clothing, electronics, etc. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for the "about" section is to provide information about the website or the company in general, as well as get the user to perform an action, such as clicking on the links for "News Feed" or "Visit eBay."</p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design is simple and professionally laid out because it has the standard layout for a webpage, such as the company logo in the top left-hand corner, information next to it to the right, as well as various features or actions down below. The "about" section alone provides the user with many options to choose from as well as links to other sources to make the user's shopping experience more enjoyable. In the left hand corder you have the company logo, as well as the company biography right next to it. These two things provide the user with a sense of trust and stability because users who are familiar with eBay or websites similar to eBay will already have a sense of trust for the company and will ultimately feel as if they can rely on this piece of information if they were to see the company logo or brand name. Down below you have a list of options which are highlighted by the color blue. This color stands out from the rest of the text because it represents a completely different energy and emotional feeling opposed to the neutral colored text because it gives the user a sense of "trust", so if they were to click on one of the links down below, they wouldn't feel as threatened by it as they would if the links were the color red, which typically represents "warning" and would give the users a sense of danger, or if the links were the color "yellow," which is typically used to represent "caution", would give the users a sense of fear and distrust. When doing research on the color blue, there are rarely any negative outcomes, so ultimately the color blue is a wise choice to use for this reason. </p>

            <img src="components/3/cta.png" alt="CTA or 'Call to Action' Image for WSP: Component 3">
            <article id="ctaArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "cta article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The cta or the "call to action" would most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who may be interested in having or at the very least browsing the latest electronic devices. This is also intended for anyone looking for a great father's day gift! </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for this cta is to promote merchandise to users so in return they will most likely see this advertisement and will want to make a purchase, or at the least will consider the opportunity. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The image in the middle of the cta stands out the most. Naturally our eyes are drawn to this enlarged image that the company wants to promote the most. Another great eye-catcher is the screen being displayed on the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. This is displaying unique features the user can have access to if they were to make a purchase. The next item I'm directed to would be the pattern at the top of the cta. The colors used are white and a nice shade of navy blue. White represents "light" and "purity", because of this it created a clean and efficient appearance, where as the color blue that is used represents "trust" and "honesty," because of this the user will be affected mentally which will stimulate clear thought and will created a sense of "calamity". The color blue is used not only for the pattern, but for the typography as well. The typography used here demonstrated a great example of hierarchy. Notice that the larger text is the main header of the cta, the title. The first thing the user will see is the price, as well as the title for the ad. After that they will see the tag line "deals for dad", giving the user the idea of a perfect father's day gift, and then lastly they will see the features as well as the link to make a purchase. </p>

<!-- 4) FEATURES -->

            <h1> 4) Features </h1>
            <img src="components/4/features.png" alt="Features Image for WSP: Component 4">
            <article id="featuresArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "features article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The "features" section will most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who are interested in buying or browsing items in a collection or bundle. This can include anything from horse racing items to clothing and accessories. Depending on the features item(s), the audience may vary. For example, in the first bundle you have a collection of horse racing items and/or equipment. This feature will most likely appeal to middle or high class families that may own a horse as well as have the finances to maintain that said horse. The second feature will most likely appeal to women between the ages of 18-35, since they are known to be savvy shoppers as well as fashionable. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for this section of the website is to provide the users with another quick and easy way of finding items that best suit their needs, except instead of them being advertised individually, they come in a bundle so that way the user will have a nice selection to choose from instead of having to browse each item separately. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout for this component nicely laid out and has a large or main image for each feature. For example, in the first feature you have an image of horse racers in action. For the second feature you have a woman wearing a beautifully made dress with a happy expression on her face. These images set the tone for the feature entirely because they display a particular emotion for the feature. For example, the girl on the right is smiling while she appears to be dancing. This will make the user want to check out these features more because it will make them feel "happy" and "cheerful." As for the font, there is a "shop now" option that is highlighted by the color "blue." By using a color instead of a neutral color for this option, this creates a more calming atmosphere for the user and will most likely allow them to click on the option rather than ignore it. </p>

            <article id="teamArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "team article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The "meet the team" feature will most likely be useful to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who may be interested in furthering their knowledge of the company or would like to get in personal contact with someone from the team who may be of assistance. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for this portion of the website is to give the users the opportunity to become more familiar with the employees so that way if they were to ever need assistance they could easily contact one of the team members just by browsing this section of the website. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout/design is well laid out and easy to navigate because everything a user will need to know about a staff member is displayed on the page. Every team member has a personalized image that provides the user with a deeper sense of trust since they are able to not only get in contact with this person via email or social media, but they will know what they look like as well. The font colors are a dark grey color that create a neutral and unemotional feeling for the user, where as the options to contact one of the team members via through social media or other sources is a nice shade of blue, that in which highlights these options so that the user will most likely want to use them. The color blue is used here as well to highlight these options. This will enable the user to rely on the brand more than they would if it were any other color since blue represents "trust" and "loyalty." </p>

            <article id="contactArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "contact article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> For the second selection, there is only a "call" option provided for the user as well as a vintage telephone for the logo. This feature seems to appeal more to older users, both male and female, between the ages of 35-65 who are members of the website or would like to become members who may need help or would like to get in touch with a representative of the company. Younger users between the ages of 18-25, however, may be more interested in seeking employment with the company and would like more information. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for this portion of the website is to allow any user to ask questions or to have a personal conversation with one of the representatives by giving them plenty of options to choose from. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design for this component is very well thought out and looks to be as convenient for the user as necessary because it gives the user many options to choose from. It's not just the standard message box and submit button. This piece of design was structured to appeal to the user as much as possible. Not only do you have the option to get in contact, but you also have the option to seek help by selecting one of the options that relates mostly to your area of interest. The user will feel a sense of stability and trust since rather than if they only had the standard message box and submit button to choose from. The color green is used to highlight each numbered selection. The color green represents "balance" and "harmony", which will make the user feel more at peace when choosing a selection. </p>

            <article id="loginArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "login article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The "log in/register" feature is the introduction of the website and will most likely be useful to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who are already a member or would like to become member. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose of the log in/register page would be the "opening door" of the website, so to speak. This will members/users to sign in/up and give them access to features limited to members only.  </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout is simple and easy to use. The color blue creates a "calming" and "professional" atmosphere for the user. The color blue is considered to be one of the most used colors when creating or designing buttons. This color is best to use since it's favored by most and users will be more willing to access the website. It's also less likely to have any negative outcomes and will most likely always have a positive reaction. On the left-hand side a darker shade of blue is used for the login section. The darker shade of blue represents "knowledge" and "authority" Users who are already members will most likely understand these emotions since they have experienced the website first hand. They will have a sense of "knowledge" because they already have enough experience with the website to know what it's all about. As for "authority", once they become members, they will be able to access features limited to members only, granting them that power. On the right-hand side, you have the register button which appears to be a lighter shade of blue. This shade of blue represents "tranquility" and "understanding", which will provide new users with the comfort in feeling as if they've made the right choice when signing up for this website. "Tranquility" gives the new user a sense of peacefulness while "understanding" gives them a sense of trust. The "sign in" button could've also been given the darker shade of blue because users will most likely be drawn to the left-hand side. A user will only have to sign up once, but will sign in multiple times. Also, the darker button is placed on a light background, where as the lighter button is placed on a light background, making the contrast best for the webpage as well as for the user. </p>

            <article id="navigationArticle"> <!-- opening article tag for "navigation article" -->
                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The "navigation" feature will most likely be useful to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who are interested in browsing various sections of the website as well as those who may want to return to a specific section. A good example being the "home page" or for this navigational bar in particular, the section for "today." </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal or purpose for the navigational bar would be to help guide the user through various sections of the website with the ease of clicking a button. Having a navigational bar is useful and recommended when creating a website in order to provide the user with the easiest and most convenient experience possible. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The design or layout for this navigational bar is simple, yet unique. The grey background creates a neutral feel that can provide the users with a sense of "indecisiveness", while still maintaining a professional outlook. The black highlight that appears whenever the user clicks on a selection will stand out the most since black is a bold color that provides the user with a sense of "elegance" and "stability." </p>

                <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
                <p> The "search" option/feature will most likely be of use to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who may need to search for an item in particular that may not be included in one the navigational selections, as well as anywhere else within the website. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal for the search bar is to allow the user to interact with the website by giving them the option to search for an item to receive direct results. The users will also have the option to search for an item by "category" instead of just the manual way of searching. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> The layout/design for the search bar is laid out nicely and appears to be quick and easy for the user to receive direct results because of advanced category options. The background inside the search bar is white, standing out from the main background to highlight the search bar's existence. The submit button is blue, giving it a very "professional" and "trustworthy" appearance, where if it were the submit button were the color red, this would confuse the user since the color red is typically used as a message of "warning" or "caution." </p>

                <p> The "footer" section will most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who may be searching for more information, such as contact information, help options, etc that they couldn't locate anywhere else on the webpage. </p>

                <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
                <p> The main goal of the footer is to not only close out the webpage in a nice and effective way, but to also provide a list of information the user may need that wouldn't likely be provided in the header or the body. The footer typically provides the copyright information as well as many other optional resources for the user. </p>

                <h2> Critique: </h2>
                <p> Opposing themes work best for the footer because it creates a its own atmosphere and almost separates itself from the rest of the page. This design in particular is professionally laid out and has an elegant appearance. The color black used for the background creates an elegant appearance because the color black represents "power" and "class." The color blue is used to highlight the main points as well as the main key words. The color blue provides the user with "stability" and "trust." These two colors mixed together creates a calming, and yet powerful atmosphere for the footer. The option at the bottom is a useful feature because the user will have the ability to share this website on multiple social networking sites of their choosing. </p>
