            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> The about section of this website will most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-65 who are interested in purchasing or selling various items, such as, clothing, electronics, etc. </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal or purpose for the "about" section is to provide information about the website or the company in general, as well as get the user to perform an action, such as clicking on the links for "News Feed" or "Visit eBay."</p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> The design is simple and professionally laid out because it has the standard layout for a webpage, such as the company logo in the top left-hand corner, information next to it to the right, as well as various features or actions down below. The "about" section alone provides the user with many options to choose from as well as links to other sources to make the user's shopping experience more enjoyable. In the left hand corder you have the company logo, as well as the company biography right next to it. These two things provide the user with a sense of trust and stability because users who are familiar with eBay or websites similar to eBay will already have a sense of trust for the company and will ultimately feel as if they can rely on this piece of information if they were to see the company logo or brand name. Down below you have a list of options which are highlighted by the color blue. This color stands out from the rest of the text because it represents a completely different energy and emotional feeling opposed to the neutral colored text because it gives the user a sense of "trust", so if they were to click on one of the links down below, they wouldn't feel as threatened by it as they would if the links were the color red, which typically represents "warning" and would give the users a sense of danger, or if the links were the color "yellow," which is typically used to represent "caution", would give the users a sense of fear and distrust. When doing research on the color blue, there are rarely any negative outcomes, so ultimately the color blue is a wise choice to use for this reason. </p>
