            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> For the second selection, there is only a "call" option provided for the user as well as a vintage telephone for the logo. This feature seems to appeal more to older users, both male and female, between the ages of 35-65 who are members of the website or would like to become members who may need help or would like to get in touch with a representative of the company. Younger users between the ages of 18-25, however, may be more interested in seeking employment with the company and would like more information. </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal or purpose for this portion of the website is to allow any user to ask questions or to have a personal conversation with one of the representatives by giving them plenty of options to choose from. </p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> The design for this component is very well thought out and looks to be as convenient for the user as necessary because it gives the user many options to choose from. It's not just the standard message box and submit button. This piece of design was structured to appeal to the user as much as possible. Not only do you have the option to get in contact, but you also have the option to seek help by selecting one of the options that relates mostly to your area of interest. The user will feel a sense of stability and trust since rather than if they only had the standard message box and submit button to choose from. The color green is used to highlight each numbered selection. The color green represents "balance" and "harmony", which will make the user feel more at peace when choosing a selection. </p>
