            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> The "log in/register" feature is the introduction of the website and will most likely be useful to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who are already a member or would like to become member. </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal or purpose of the log in/register page would be the "opening door" of the website, so to speak. This will members/users to sign in/up and give them access to features limited to members only.  </p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> The layout is simple and easy to use. The color blue creates a "calming" and "professional" atmosphere for the user. The color blue is considered to be one of the most used colors when creating or designing buttons. This color is best to use since it's favored by most and users will be more willing to access the website. It's also less likely to have any negative outcomes and will most likely always have a positive reaction. On the left-hand side a darker shade of blue is used for the login section. The darker shade of blue represents "knowledge" and "authority" Users who are already members will most likely understand these emotions since they have experienced the website first hand. They will have a sense of "knowledge" because they already have enough experience with the website to know what it's all about. As for "authority", once they become members, they will be able to access features limited to members only, granting them that power. On the right-hand side, you have the register button which appears to be a lighter shade of blue. This shade of blue represents "tranquility" and "understanding", which will provide new users with the comfort in feeling as if they've made the right choice when signing up for this website. "Tranquility" gives the new user a sense of peacefulness while "understanding" gives them a sense of trust. The "sign in" button could've also been given the darker shade of blue because users will most likely be drawn to the left-hand side. A user will only have to sign up once, but will sign in multiple times. Also, the darker button is placed on a light background, where as the lighter button is placed on a light background, making the contrast best for the webpage as well as for the user. </p>
