            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> The target audience for this "call to action" in particular would be anyone interested in having the latest electronic devices. This is also intended for anyone looking for a great father's day gift! </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal or purpose for this cta is to promote our merchandise to our users so in return they will most likely see this advertisement and will want to make a purchase, or at the least will consider the opportunity. </p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> I really love the design for this cta. What stands out to me the most is the unique pattern at the top. The pattern is an eye-catcher and will grab the user's attention right away. It also creates a "hierarchy" that will lead the user down step by step. The next eye-catcher would be the price as well as the tag in the right-hand corner. The design is crafted very well it goes nicely with the promoted item. </p>
