            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> The cta or the "call to action" would most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who may be interested in having or at the very least browsing the latest electronic devices. This is also intended for anyone looking for a great father's day gift! </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal or purpose for this cta is to promote merchandise to users so in return they will most likely see this advertisement and will want to make a purchase, or at the least will consider the opportunity. </p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> The image in the middle of the cta stands out the most. Naturally our eyes are drawn to this enlarged image that the company wants to promote the most. Another great eye-catcher is the screen being displayed on the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. This is displaying unique features the user can have access to if they were to make a purchase. The next item I'm directed to would be the pattern at the top of the cta. The colors used are white and a nice shade of navy blue. White represents "light" and "purity", because of this it created a clean and efficient appearance, where as the color blue that is used represents "trust" and "honesty," because of this the user will be affected mentally which will stimulate clear thought and will created a sense of "calamity". The color blue is used not only for the pattern, but for the typography as well. The typography used here demonstrated a great example of hierarchy. Notice that the larger text is the main header of the cta, the title. The first thing the user will see is the price, as well as the title for the ad. After that they will see the tag line "deals for dad", giving the user the idea of a perfect father's day gift, and then lastly they will see the features as well as the link to make a purchase. </p>
