            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> The target audience for the footer area of this website would be anyone who may be searching for more information, such as contact information, help options, etc. </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal of the footer is to not only close out the webpage in a nice and effective way, but to also provide a list of information the user may need that wouldn't likely be provided in the header or the body. The footer typically provided the copyright information as well as many other optional resources for the user. </p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> I find that having an opposing theme to be best for the footer because it creates a its own atmosphere and almost seperates itself from the rest of the webpage. This design in particular is professionally laid out and has an elegant appearance. I love the use of the color "blue" because it highlights the main points as well as the main key words. I also find the option at the bottom to be useful because the user will have the ability to share this website on multiple social networking sites of their choosing. </p>
