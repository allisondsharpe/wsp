            <h2> Target Audience: </h2>
            <p> The "footer" section will most likely appeal to men and women between the ages of 18-35 who may be searching for more information, such as contact information, help options, etc that they couldn't locate anywhere else on the webpage. </p>

            <h2> Client/User Needs: </h2>
            <p> The main goal of the footer is to not only close out the webpage in a nice and effective way, but to also provide a list of information the user may need that wouldn't likely be provided in the header or the body. The footer typically provides the copyright information as well as many other optional resources for the user. </p>

            <h2> Critique: </h2>
            <p> Opposing themes work best for the footer because it creates a its own atmosphere and almost separates itself from the rest of the page. This design in particular is professionally laid out and has an elegant appearance. The color black used for the background creates an elegant appearance because the color black represents "power" and "class." The color blue is used to highlight the main points as well as the main key words. The color blue provides the user with "stability" and "trust." These two colors mixed together creates a calming, and yet powerful atmosphere for the footer. The option at the bottom is a useful feature because the user will have the ability to share this website on multiple social networking sites of their choosing. </p>
